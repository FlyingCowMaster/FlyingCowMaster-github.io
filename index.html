    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I went to Burlington County Institute of Technology in NJ.
        It was here that I studied IT and got my CompTIA A+ and Security+ certifications.
       I like computers. I haven't done too much programing, but I do have a homelab
       that I mess around with. I also use linux. Besides that I like video games and anime.
